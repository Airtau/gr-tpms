# gr-tpms

Software for capturing, demodulating, decoding, and assessing data from
automotive tire pressure monitors using GNU Radio.

Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) are becoming common on automobiles,
and in certain countries, are required as a condition of sale. Most TPMS
devices use simple wireless communication techniques such as:

* ASK or FSK modulation
* Manchester bit coding
* Small CRCs or checksums
* Unique device identifiers

# Software

This software was developed for and tested with:

* [rtl-sdr](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)
* [GNU Radio](http://gnuradio.org) 3.7.3
* [Python](http://python.org) 2.7
* [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) Numerical Python library.
* [SciPy](http://scipy.org/scipylib/) Scientific Python library.
* [PyFFTW](http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/) Python interface to FFTW.
* [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org) Fastest FFT in the West.
* [PyTZ](http://pytz.sourceforge.net) Timezone library.
* [crcmod](http://crcmod.sourceforge.net), CRC library for Python.

# Hardware

I used a variety of hardware for receiving tire pressure monitors. If you don't already
have a software-defined radio receiver, a $50 US investment is all you need to get started.

### Quick Shopping List for The Impatient

Aside from a modern and fairly fast computer capable of running GNU Radio, here's what you'll need:

* [NooElec TV28T v2 DVB-T USB Stick (R820T) w/ Antenna and Remote Control](http://www.nooelec.com/store/software-defined-radio/tv28tv2.html) or [Hacker Warehouse DVB-T USB 2.0](http://hackerwarehouse.com/product/dvb-t-usb2-0/)
* [NooElec Male MCX to Female SMA Adapter](http://www.nooelec.com/store/software-defined-radio/male-mcx-to-female-sma-adapter.html)
* [Linx Technologies ANT-315-CW-RH-SMA 315MHz 51mm (2") helical whip antenna, SMA](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-315-CW-RH-SMA) or [Linx Technologies ANT-433-CW-RH-SMA 433MHz 51mm (2") helical whip antenna, SMA](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-433-CW-RH-SMA)
* [Johnson / Emerson Connectivity Solutions 415-0031-024 SMA male to SMA female cable, 61cm (24")](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=415-0031-024), (Optional, if you don't want your antenna sticking straight out of your USB receiver dongle.)

### Receiver

If you're just getting started with SDR, I highly recommend getting a DVB-T USB dongle,
supported by the [rtl-sdr](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) project. They cost
$25 US, typically.

Recommended DVB-T dongle vendors include:

* [Hacker Warehouse](http://hackerwarehouse.com/product/dvb-t-usb2-0/)
* [NooElec](http://www.nooelec.com/store/software-defined-radio.html)

If you're looking to do active attacks on TPMS (a topic I haven't explored), I recommend
the [HackRF](https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/).

### Antenna

The antenna that comes with your DVB-T dongle will work well, but you'll get more signal
and less noise with a band-specific antenna.

For 315MHz:
* Linx Technologies [ANT-315-CW-RH-SMA](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-315-CW-RH-SMA) 315MHz 51mm (2") helical whip antenna, SMA.
* Linx Technologies [ANT-315-CW-RH](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-315-CW-RH) 315MHz 51mm (2") helical whip antenna, RP-SMA.
* Linx Technologies [ANT-315-CW-HWR-SMA](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-315-CW-HWR-SMA) 315MHz 142mm (5.6") tilt/swivel whip antenna, SMA.
* Linx Technologies [ANT-315-CW-HWR-RPS](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-315-CW-HWR-RPS) 315MHz 142mm (5.6") tilt/swivel whip antenna, RP-SMA.

For 433MHz:
* Linx Technologies [ANT-433-CW-RH-SMA](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-433-CW-RH-SMA) 433MHz 51mm (2") helical whip antenna, SMA.
* Linx Technologies [ANT-433-CW-RH](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-433-CW-RH) 433MHz 51mm (2") helical whip antenna, RP-SMA.
* Linx Technologies [ANT-433-CW-HWR-SMA](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-433-CW-HWR-SMA) 433MHz 142mm (5.6") tilt/swivel whip antenna, SMA.
* Linx Technologies [ANT-433-CW-HWR-RPS](http://mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=ANT-433-CW-HWR-RPS) 433MHz 142mm (5.6") tilt/swivel whip antenna, RP-SMA.

I'm using the Linx Technologies ANT-315-CW-RH-SMA and ANT-433-CW-RH-SMA with good
results, but you may prefer bigger antennas, or RP-SMA connectors.

Ideally, I'd build a [Yagi-Uda antenna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi-Uda_antenna). :-)

### Cabling

You'll need a cable to connect the antenna to the DVB-T dongle. The DVB-T dongles
from Hacker Warehouse and NooElec have a female MCX connector. The SMA antennas I
use have a male SMA connector. So you'll want a 50 Ohm cable with a male MCX
connector on one side, and a female SMA connector on the other.

### Filtering

I like to use a SAW filter between the antenna and receiver to further cut noise
and interference. It's certainly not necessary (and likely overkill). The SAW
filter I use is built from a PCB I designed.

# Building

Assuming you have the above prerequisites installed, clone this repo and do the
following:

    cd gr-tpms
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    # Or use ccmake to make adjustments. I've had to tweak Python paths on Mac OS X.
    make
    sudo make install

# Using

Once gr-tpms is installed, you may use it in two modes, a live capture mode, or
decoding from a file. To run live using an RTL-SDR dongle as a signal source:

    tpms_rx --source rtlsdr

Or using a HackRF:

    tpms_rx --source hackrf

To detect and decode from a file:

    tpms_rx --file <filename of complex<float32> file sampled at 400kHz>

Optional arguments to tpms_rx include:

    --bursts: Output a complex<float32> file of each burst of significant energy.
    --raw: Output undecoded bits of detected packets.

To make use of raw burst files, to identify new packet types not currently handled
by gr-tpms, see my sister project, [tpms](https://github.com/jboone/tpms), which
contains some visualization and testing tools and techniques.
